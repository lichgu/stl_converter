# stl_converter

Two python scripts to convert STL files
- from binary to ascii
- from ascii to binary

Disclaimer: The conversion from binary to ascii is based on code by Issei Mori and was adapted from python 2 to python 3 (the original version can be
found here: https://github.com/IsseiMori/binary-stl-toASCII/).
